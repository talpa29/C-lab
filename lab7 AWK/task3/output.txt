true love is but a humble low-born thing and hath its food served up in earthen ware it is a thing to walk with hand in hand through the every-dayness of this work-day world baring its tender feet to every roughness yet letting not one heart-beat go astrayfrom beauty's law of plainness and content a simple fire-side thing whose quiet smilecan warm earth's poorest hovel to a home which when our autumn cometh as it must and life in the chill wind shivers bare and leafless shall still be blest with indian-summer youthin bleak november and with thankful heart smile on its ample stores of garnered fruit as full of sunshine to our aged eyesas when it nursed the blossoms of our spring---such is true love which steals into the heartwith feet as silent as the lightsome dawnthat kisses smooth the rough brows of the dark and hath its will through blissful gentleness not like a rocket which with savage glare whirrs suddenly up then bursts and leaves the nightpainfully quivering on the dazed eyes a love that gives and takes that seeth faults not with flaw-seeking eyes like needle-points but loving kindly ever looks them downwith the o'ercoming faith of meek forgiveness a love that shall be new and fresh each hour as is the golden mystery of sunset or the sweet coming of the evening-star alike and yet most unlike every day and seeming ever best and fairest now a love that doth not kneel for what it seeks but faces truth and beauty as their peer showing its worthiness of noble thoughtsby a clear sense of inward nobleness a love that in its object findeth notall grace and beauty and enough to sateits thirst of blessing but in all of goodfound there it sees but heaven-granted typesof good and beauty in the soul of man and traces in the simplest heart that beats a family-likeness to its chosen one that claims of it the rights of brotherhood---for love is blind but with the fleshly eye that so its inner sight may be more clear and outward shows of beauty only soare needful at the first as is a handto guide and to uphold an infant's steps:great spirits need them not their earnest lookpierces the body's mask of thin disguise and beauty ever is to them revealed behind the unshapeliest meanest lump of clay with arms outstretched and eager face ablaze yearning to be but understood and loved
